This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and past interactions. It leverages machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations.

Features:
      Personalized Recommendations: Recommends movies based on user preferences.
      Trending Movies: Shows trending or popular movies.
      Search Functionality: Allows users to search for specific movies.
      Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on other users with similar tastes.
      Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on movie genres, keywords, and metadata.
Tech Stack-
  Programming Language: Python
    Libraries:
      pandas for data manipulation
      scikit-learn for building machine learning models
      numpy for numerical operations
      flask or streamlit (optional, if you created a web app interface)
    Data: MovieLens dataset or a custom dataset of movies

Installation:
      git clone https://github.com/imsudhanshu09/Movie_Recommendation.git
      cd movie-recommendation-system
      pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
      Prepare the dataset: Ensure that the dataset is in the correct format.
      Run the recommendation system: python main.py
      If you have a web interface, run it: flask run or streamlit run app.py
      Access the system in your browser at http://localhost:5000 (or similar, depending on your setup).

Models Used:
      Collaborative Filtering: Uses user-item interactions for recommendations.
      Content-Based Filtering: Uses movie metadata to recommend similar movies.
      Hybrid Model (optional): Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendations.

Future Enhancements:
      Add support for more complex models like Deep Learning.
      Implement a more advanced User Interface.
      Include real-time recommendations based on user activity.
